<h2>Below are a list of steps and screenshots that demonstrate how I easily installed Mozilla Firefox.</h2>

1. I opened the Linux command line. Installing applications on Linux demand a little more steps. I had to enter SUDO, which stands for "SUperuser Do" before the specific orders. There are also other words needed in order to make sure the commands are executed correctly.
